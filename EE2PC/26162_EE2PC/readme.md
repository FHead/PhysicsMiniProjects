What you will need

1. TextToTree and CompileRootMacro utilities from Yi.  She'll update the code to remove these external dependencies if anyone wants to use this code.  Just let her know
2. xelatex.  This is to add the MOD logo

To rerun plots, use the Figure[2-5] recipe in the makefile.  Like...
